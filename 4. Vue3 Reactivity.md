### 1. How can we save the total calculation?

```js

let prict = 5;
let quantity = 2;
let total = price * quantitiy;

console.log(`total is ${total}`); // total is 10

price = 20;

console.log(`totla is ${total}`); // totla is 10

```

```js

let price = 5;
let quantity = 2;
let total = 0;

let dep = new Set(); // to store our effects

let effect = () => {total = price * quantity};

function track() {dep.add(effect)};
function trigger() {dep.forEach(effect => effect())};

track();
effect();



```

- Often our objects will have multiple properties and each property will need their own dep.

dep: dependency whic is a set of effects that should get re run when values change
